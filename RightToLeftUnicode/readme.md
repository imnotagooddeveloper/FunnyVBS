Just a text file? why would i want?<br>
Sir listen.<br>
this unicode character forces chars right to left<br>
For example: lets say this char is ! and your file is notmalware.exe<br>
you place ! notmalw!are.exe and it turns this file into notmalwexe.era<br>
"IS THIS WORKS ON WINDOWS?!?" yep it works on linux too not checked for macos tho<br>
the thing you can do with this has no limit you can add this at start of name too<br>
maybe you cant hack into cloudflare or kaspersky with it but you can make a exe file look like a powerpoint file and troll your teacher? :)<br>

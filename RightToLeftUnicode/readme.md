Just a text file? why would i want?
Sir listen.
this unicode character forces chars right to left
For example: lets say this char is ! and your file is notmalware.exe
you place ! notmalw!are.exe and it turnst this file into notmalwexe.rea
"IS THIS WORKS ON WINDOWS" yep it works on linux too
maybe you cant hack into cloudflare or kaspersky with it but you can make a exe file look like a powerpoint file? :)

Just a text file? why would i want?<br>
Sir listen.<br>
this unicode character forces chars right to left<br>
For example: lets say this char is ! and your file is notmalware.exe<br>
you place ! notmalw!are.exe and it turnst this file into notmalwexe.era<br>
"IS THIS WORKS ON WINDOWS" yep it works on linux too<br>
maybe you cant hack into cloudflare or kaspersky with it but you can make a exe file look like a powerpoint file and troll your teacher? :)<br>
